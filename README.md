# JSONScan

A command line ICA scanning client for Mac OS X 10.7 and higher.

JSONScan is a fork of [scanline](https://github.com/klep/scanline) that enables interprocess communication using JSON through stdio.

The purpose of JSONScan is to make it easy for languages, other than objective-c or swift, to use ImageKit, without a cocoa bridge or native bindings.

## It is a work in progress.
